# ExcelToGeoJSON
Functionality for transforming an Excel file containing geolocation information to a GeoJSON file

## Use Case
The scripts are mainly for a personal project and have most likely no public use.
(They could be useful for a reference on how to work with Excel, Pandas and GeoJSON in Python though.)
